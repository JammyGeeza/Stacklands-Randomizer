# Stacklands Archipelago Randomizer
A mod for Stacklands that allows it to be integrated into an Archipelago world.

This repo was forked from and is a continuation of the development of the original mod: [chandler05/Stacklands-Randomizer](https://github.com/chandler05/Stacklands-Randomizer)

## How it Works
In each run, all quests are checks and all Booster Packs and Ideas are items received from checks.

### Current Support
- Mainland _(full support)_
- ~~The Dark Forest~~ _(coming soon...)_
- ~~The Island~~ _(coming soon...)_
- ~~DLC~~ _(not yet planned)_

## Known Issues
For the list of currently known issues, please see the [open issues](https://github.com/JammyGeeza/Stacklands-Randomizer/issues)

## How to Install the Mod to Stacklands
1. Download the `StacklandsRandomizer-vX.X.X.zip` file included in your chosen release. _([find the latest release here](https://github.com/JammyGeeza/Stacklands-Randomizer/releases/latest))_
2. Navigate to `%LocalAppData%low\sokpop\Stacklands\Mods`.
   - _This path will look something like `C:\[user]\AppData\LocalLow\sokpop\Stacklands\Mods`_
3. Extract the contents of the `StacklandsRandomizer-vX.X.X.zip` file to this directory.
   - _Your directory structure should be: `..\sokpop\Stacklands\Mods\StacklandsRandomizer\[all .dll, .json etc. files here]`_
4. Start the game

## How to Use the Mod
1. From the Main Menu, go to `Mods -> Archipelago Randomizer`
2. Enter the server name (including port), the Slot Name and the password (if required)
3. Click 'Connect' - the game will quickly restart. _(This is a temporary solution for now)_
4. If successful, the main menu box should now display `"Archipelago: Connected"`
5. Start a new run - a new game save dedicated to the server's seed will have been created so your existing game saves are safe. 
6. Once you have completed your goal, go back to `Mods -> Archipelago Randomizer` and click `Send Goal`. It will _only_ send once you have completed your goal. _(This is a temporary solution for now)_
