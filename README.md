# Stacklands Archipelago Randomizer
A mod for Stacklands that allows it to be integrated into an Archipelago world.

This repo was forked from and is a continuation of the development of the original mod: [chandler05/Stacklands-Randomizer](https://github.com/chandler05/Stacklands-Randomizer)

## How to Install the Mod to Stacklands
1. Download `StacklandsRandomizer vX.X.X.zip` file.
2. Extract the contents of the `.zip` file to: `%LocalAppData%low\sokpop\Mods`
3. Start the Game

## How to Use the Mod
1. From the Main Menu, go to `Mods -> Archipelago Randomizer`
2. Enter the server name (including port), the Slot Name and the password (if required)
3. Click 'Connect' - the game will quickly restart. _(This is a temporary solution for now)_
4. If successful, the main menu box should now display `"Archipelago: Connected"`
5. Start a new run - a new game save dedicated to the server's seed will have been created so your existing game saves are safe. 
6. Once you have completed your goal, go back to `Mods -> Archipelago Randomizer` and click `Send Goal`. It will _only_ send once you have completed your goal. _(This is a temporary solution for now)_
